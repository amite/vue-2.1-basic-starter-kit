## How to use this starter pack

![Quill Labs Logo](https://github.com/amite/vue-2.1-basic-starter-kit/raw/master/screenshots/quill-logomark.png)

Node modules are pre-installed so just do `git clone https://github.com/amite/vue-2.1-basic-starter-kit.git`

Make sure have gulp installed on your machine before you run this kit.
You can do this with `npm install --global gulp-cli`

To run your demos, just do `gulp serve` and a [browserSync](https://www.browsersync.io) server will start with live reloading. You should install the free [chrome live reload extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en) to get live reloading in your browser.

Css, JS and other assets can be found in the `src` folder.

Happy hacking ðŸ˜€
